# EcoDynamics: Predator-Prey Simulation

## Project Overview
This project proposal presents a simulation study of ecosystem dynamics, focusing on predator–prey interactions and resource competition. The goal is to model predator–prey interactions using mathematical models such as Lotka–Volterra and Logistic growth with Holling II functional response.  

## Status
- Initial repo setup complete
- Entity classes (`Prey`, `Predator`, `Environment`) created 
- Core models to be added

## Installation Instructions
